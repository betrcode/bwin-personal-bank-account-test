An assignment I did for bwin once upon a time. 

The assignment is done using Java, Tapestry and Hibernate.

For assignment requirements, see: assignment_test.html

----------------------------------------------------------



Choices for webapp
------------------

* Chose Tapestry web framework for rapid development and "all Java" approach.

* Using HSQLDB with Hibernate to simplify creation of webapp. (Instead of personal preference of DAO's + JDBC + Oracle.)

* Ignoring HTML/CSS design stuff and focus on functionality.

* Zero test coverage because it would take longer and the project is not going to live long. :-)


Database model is created by Hibernate based on the User entity class. (Which is the only thing I am persisting.)

E-mail functionality not finished.

Register page built in addition to assignment requirements.


Project is built using Maven 2.2.1 and Java 1.6.0_16

To build: "mvn install" / "mvn clean install"
To run: "mvn jetty:run"
